- 👋 Hi, I’m @LucasNseyep (Lucas is fine)
- 👀 I’m interested in the use of technology in accessibility and entertainment. As well as how new technologies in niche/specific fields can trickle down to the average person.
- 🌱 I recently finished a bootcamp at Le Wagon London in Full Stack Web Development!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that would help me learn more about CS and WD 🤷
- 🤔 Fun fact, that is not my picture. The picture is a pixelised portrait of Alessandro de' Medici, the first Duke of Florence, who was of African heritage. Read more about his story [here](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/secret/famous/medici.html).
