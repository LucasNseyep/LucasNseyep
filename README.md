- 👋 Hi, I’m @LucasNseyep (Lucas is fine)
- 👀 I’m interested in the use of technology in accessibility and entertainment. As well as how new technologies in niche/specific fields can trickle down to the average person.
- 🌱 I recently finished a full-time 9-week intensive bootcamp in Full Stack Web Development at Le Wagon London!🥳
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything CS and/or WD 🤷. I love to learn!
- 🤔 Fun fact, that is not my picture. The picture is a pixelised portrait of Alessandro de' Medici, the first Duke of Florence, who was of African heritage. Read about his story [here](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/secret/famous/medici.html).
