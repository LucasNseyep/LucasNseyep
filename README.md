- 👋 Hi, I’m @LucasNseyep (Lucas is fine)
- 👀 I’m interested by the intersection of accessibility and technology. And how new technologies in niche/specific fields can trickle down to the average person.
- 🌱 I’m recently finished a bootcamp at Le Wagon London in Web development!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that seems cool honestly 🤷
- 📫 How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-nseyep/
