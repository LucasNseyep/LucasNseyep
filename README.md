- 👋 Hi, I’m @LucasNseyep (Lucas is fine)
- 👀 I’m interested in the use of technology of accessibility and entertainment. As well as how new technologies in niche/specific fields can trickle down to the average person.
- 🌱 I recently finished a bootcamp at Le Wagon London in Full Stack Web Development!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that would help me learn honestly 🤷
